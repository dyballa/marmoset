First choose the folder corresponding to the latest date (older ones are kept for future reference).The `frames` folder contains all frames (12,480) in the movie. It is supposed to be diplayed at 60 fps, so the total time should be close to 3.5 min.

`stim_frames.txt` is a list of all stimuli and their respective onset frame numbers.

`load_images.m` is a Matlab script to load all frames into a matlab array --> needs to be tested!

Please ignore the other files; they contain information about how the movie was generated.
